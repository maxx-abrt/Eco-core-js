## Why Sustainable Web Development?

Digital technology accounts for approximately 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with this figure projected to double by 2025. Websites and web applications contribute significantly to this footprint through:

- Energy-intensive data centers
- Network infrastructure
- Device power consumption
- Resource-heavy frontend experiences

By optimizing web applications, we can collectively reduce this environmental impact while improving user experience through faster, more efficient websites.
